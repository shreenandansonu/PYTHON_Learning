## Mastermind - Color Guessing Game

Mastermind is a fun color-sequence guessing game built using **Python** and **Tkinter**.
The goal is to correctly guess a secret 4-color code randomly generated from the colors:
- R (Red)
- G (Green)
- B (Blue)
- V (Violet)
- Y (Yellow)
- O (Orange)
- W (White).

Enter your 4-letter color guess in the input box and press Enter.

After each guess, the game shows:

- Correct: Number of colors that are correct and in the correct position.
- Incorrect: Number of correct colors but in the wrong position.
- Rounds: Number of attempts you have made so far.

If you guess all 4 colors correctly in their correct positions, you win!
A congratulatory message will be shown along with the number of rounds you took.

If you want to start over anytime, you can click the RESET button to begin a new game.

The game has a clean and colorful interface, with fixed window size and a dark green theme that enhances the experience.
It also tracks your performance to encourage you to guess the sequence in as few rounds as possible!
